I am a Lecturer in Digital Environment at <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/">School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/">Queen Mary University of London</a>ï¼Œ where I lead the <strong>Motion AI Lab</strong>. I hold a PhD from Imperial College London, where my research focused on hand pose estimation. My research interests are machine learning and computer vision, particularly 3D digital humans and motion intelligence. I am an Associate Editor for The Visual Computer journal. I regularly review for major computer vision conferences (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and NeurIPS) and related journals (TPAMI, IJCV and TIP).
